        <h3>Var Let Const:</h3>
        <p>The main differences between var, let, and const are their scoping rules, meaning where they can be used in the code. 

            Var: Variables declared with the keyword "var" are globally scoped or function scoped. Variables declared with var can be re-declared and updated. 
            
            Let: Variables declared with the keyword "let" are block scoped. Variables declared with let can be re-declared but not updated. 
            
            Const: Variables declared with the keyword "const" are block scoped. Variables declared with const cannot be re-declared but can be updated.</p>
      
            <h3>Template String:</h3>
            <p>In JavaScript, a template string is a string that is surrounded by backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes. Template strings are a new feature in ECMAScript 6 (also known as ECMAScript 2015) and provide a more concise syntax for defining strings that span multiple lines or that include string interpolation (i.e., the ability to embed expressions inside string literals).</p>
        
            <h3>Api:</h3>
            <p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of guidelines, protocols, and tools for building software and applications. An API allows different software systems to communicate with each other and share data and functionality.

                In the context of JavaScript, an API refers to a set of functions or methods that can be accessed by a JavaScript program running in a web browser or on a server. For example, a JavaScript program might use an API provided by a web server to retrieve data from a database, or it might use an API provided by a web service to access data from a third-party application.
                
                APIs are often provided as part of a library or framework, such as the JavaScript standard library or a popular JavaScript framework like React or Angular. APIs may also be provided by external services or applications, such as a weather service or a social media platform, which can be accessed through HTTP requests made from a JavaScript program.
                
                APIs typically include documentation that describes the functionality provided by the API and how to use it. This documentation may include information about the input and output parameters for each function or method, as well as examples of how to use the API in different contexts.</p>
